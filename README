This is a set of jQuery exercises and plugins that are created just to prove to myself that I can truly use jQuery like I think I can. It really isn't much for anyone else but myself.

If you look at this code, never take into consideration any of the "design", or at least be prepared to immediately eyebleach afterward.

Thank you.
